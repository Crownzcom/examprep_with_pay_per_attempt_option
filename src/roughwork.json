      "question": "<p>Poverty is a situation where families and individuals lack the necessities of life, such as decent housing, adequate food, clothing, or other requirements for healthy living. The income of families and individuals living in conditions of poverty is not enough to afford these items.</p> <p>Many young people in school come from families that are facing the problem of poverty. Poverty makes it difficult for parents or guardians to provide the young with the basic requirements for decent or comfortable living at home or school. Conditions of poverty, if not well handled, can lead to a loss of self-esteem and affect academic performance and how young people relate to others. In an attempt to get what they do not have, some youth have resorted to such practices as prostitution, having relationships with sugar daddies and sugar mummies, and stealing from fellow students or other people.</p> <p>Young people should not devalue themselves by engaging in immoral or illegal activities to get money or other material things. Various measures can help them overcome poverty. The first thing young people in conditions of poverty should do is appreciate who they are and the efforts of their parents and guardians to educate them. We are all created in the image of God, poor or rich. We are all equal before God.</p> <p>Every parent would like their children to be as comfortable as possible. Young people should avoid comparing themselves to other people and passing judgment against themselves as being deprived. Such self-pity will only serve to demoralize them and rob them of energy for working hard to get out of poverty. They should also learn to be content with what they have and work towards making life better.</p> <p>As believers in God, they should not allow conditions of poverty to take away their happiness. True happiness comes from God, not material things.</p> <p>Conditions of poverty are not permanent. With hard work utilizing knowledge and skills acquired at school, young people can contribute to family efforts to get out of poverty. They should be positive, and discuss with their parents or guardians how they can contribute to increasing or saving family income.</p> <p>There is also a need for students to use their pocket money sparingly and make sure that all items like basins, uniforms, books, and scholastic materials are not lost. This saves parents the costly burden of replacing such items. Finally, young people should not make excessive demands on their parents or guardians, which parents or guardians cannot afford. This will only serve to frustrate the young people themselves as well as their guardians or parents.</p> <p><b>(Adapted from PIASCY, a student handbook on HIV/AIDS.)</b></p>",

      "question": "<p>“Angodi Secondary Secondary was located in the center of Uganda, where the lively colours of the surrounding terrain reflected the lively lives of its people. This school, which was situated at the base of the towering Mount Kareu, saw the highs and lows of adolescent friendships, rivalries, and emotions. The story of an unexpected fight that was fueled by the difficulty of teenage love emerged at school.</p><p>Two friends named Samuel and Peter were in the middle of a conflict. They had shared secrets, jokes, and the kind of companionship that only comes from high school friends. Their friendship appeared to be unbreakable because they had been friends for so long, but when Aisha, a new student, joined their class, the delicate friendship between them began to go bad. Her arrival was like a breath of fresh air, drawing attention and raising murmurs in Angodi Secondary school. With her happy smile and lively conduct, Aisha unintentionally sparked a conflict between the two friends. Both Samuel and Peter were attracted by Aisha's presence, and what started as harmless love soon evolved into a competition neither had expected. The classroom, which used to be filled with laughter and group study sessions, became a battleground of insults and unsaid conflicts.</p><p>As the days passed, the rift between the friends widened. Samuel's attempts to engage Aisha in conversation were met with a cold shoulder, while Peter found himself as Aisha’s favourite. This created huge hatred between the two former friends.</p><p>One seemingly routine lunch break was the turning moment in the long-boiling tension. As the students assembled in small groups, conversing and sharing lunch, the sun burnt down on the courtyard, creating lengthy shadows. Ignorant of the storm gathering around her, Aisha was buried in reading her book as she sat at a corner table.</p><p>Samuel attacked Peter, accusing him of destroying their friendship by seeking Aisha's attention. Word by word, the two once friends were now exchanging bitterly. Sensing the approaching tempest, the nearby students gathered into a circle, their murmurs providing a backdrop for the approaching confrontation.</p> <p>BThe confrontation intensified into a physical fight. The once-united friends found themselves engaged in a huge fight, each one throwing severe punches at each other. Their friendship was now replaced by the bitter taste of betrayal. The compound that had witnessed countless friendships grow, now bore witness to the heartbreaking expiry of friendship.</p><p>Mr. Odongo, the head of disciplinary at the school, hurried to the scene while the fight was taking place. He parted the fighters with a severe look, clearly disappointed. With expressions that blended sorrow, rage, and shame, the two of them were led to the principal's office.</p>",
