      I love our village.
      <br/>
      A village full of forgiveness;
      <br/>
      We all live in peace;
      <br/>
      The peace we protect and enjoy.
     </p>
     <p>
      I like our village.
      <br/>
      A village full of love for one another;
      <br/>
      We
      <u>
       protect
      </u>
      our animals, gardens and homes;
      <br/>
      Education, good health are ours.
     </p>
     <p>
      I like our village.
      <br/>
      A village of wise people;
      <br/>
      Elders give words of wisdom to the young;
      <br/>
      We, their dearest children, listen in humility.
     </p>
     <p>
      Oh! Peaceful Malala Village!
      <br/>
      Let other villages
      <u>
       admire
      </u>
      and learn from us;
      <br/>
      To love our motherland, Uganda;
      <br/>
      We are one people, together we stand strong.
     </p>
