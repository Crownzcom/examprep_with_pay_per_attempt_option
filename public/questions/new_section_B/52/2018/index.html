            <p>Holidays, sweet holidays!<br>
                The time everybody needs,<br>
                After hard and serious work,<br>
                To rest and feel fresh again.
            </p>
            <p>Holidays, sweet holidays!<br>
                That precious time for teachers and pupils,<br>
                Keep away from books,<br>
                And celebrate success.
            </p>
            <p>Holidays, sweet holidays!<br>
                Rest time for the public and civil servants,<br>
                To stay home and relax,<br>
                Labour Day, Womenâ€™s Day, Independence Day.
            </p>
            <p>Holidays, sweet holidays!<br>
                For believers to thank and praise God,<br>
                For His wisdom, mercy and kindness,<br>
                Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays.
