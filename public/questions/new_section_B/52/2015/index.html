            <p>
                We pray for peace. <br>
                Peace in our homes, schools <br>
                Peace for the whole world <br>
                Without peace there is fear
            </p>
            <p>
                We are tired of social problems <br>
                Child sacrifices, robberies, killings <br>
                We are not animals <br>
                To be slaughtered.
            </p>
            <p>
                We need protection <br>
                From all forms of crimes <br>
                For, with love and care <br>
                Our community will shine
            </p>
            <p>
                We thank the army and the police <br>
                For controlling crimes in the community. <br>
                Allowing us to enjoy ourselves <br>
                In the world that God created.
            </p>
