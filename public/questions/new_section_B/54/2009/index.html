     Cassava, cassava, cassava,
     <br/>
     Cassava everywhere;
     <br/>
     Cassava in every garden,
     <br/>
     Every garden green with it, Every
     <br/>
     garden heavy with it,
     <br/>
     It was a cassava year.
    </p>
    <p>
     A swarm of red visitors flew in,
     <br/>
     Cassava hosts entertained them,
     <br/>
     And warm
     <u>
      hospitality
     </u>
     it was,
     <br/>
     For the visitors soon forgot,
     <br/>
     The way that had brought them,
     <br/>
     And decided to stay forever.
    </p>
    <p>
     Day and night their mission was,
     <br/>
     To feed, drink, sleep and mate;
     <br/>
     They slept
     <u>
      intoxicated
     </u>
     with drink and food,
     <br/>
     Until their
     <u>
      bellies
     </u>
     gave way to babies;
     <br/>
     Soon young ones crawled everywhere,
     <br/>
     Living to eat, in a foreign country.
    </p>
    <p>
     The fathers, mothers, daughters and sons,
     <br/>
     Declared war on their hosts and,
     <br/>
     Their children whom they killed,
     <br/>
     Mercilessly …………… total destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
     Time…………………………
     <br/>
     Always too
     <br/>
     Short for the diligent,
     <br/>
     Always too
     <br/>
     Much for the indolent.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Key:
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Intoxicated = drunk
     <br/>
     Diligent = hardworking
     <br/>
     Indolent = lazy
