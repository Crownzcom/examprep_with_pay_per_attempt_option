     Defilement! Defilement!
     <br/>
     What a social
     <u>
      evil
     </u>
     !
     <br/>
     In towns, villages, schools, homes,
     <br/>
     Everywhere defilement!
     <br/>
     Young girls and boys are victims.
    </p>
    <p>
     The
     <u>
      merciless
     </u>
     people!
     <br/>
     The sugar daddies and mummies,
     <br/>
     Trick young girls and boys,
     <br/>
     Using money and other gifts,
     <br/>
     To meet their selfish desires.
    </p>
    <p>
     Everyday innocent girls and boys,
     <br/>
     Are infected with HIV/AIDS!
     <br/>
     Some drop out of school,
     <br/>
     While other die,
     <br/>
     Due to defilement.
    </p>
    <p>
     This is my advice!
     <br/>
     Young girls and boys say no to money and gifts.
     <br/>
     The police, help to arrest,
     <br/>
     And prosecute the men and women,
     <br/>
     Who commit such crimes.
