     Nkondo primary school organized a sport day, all the pupils were divided into house and each house had a house leader
            elected by pupils of that house. The house were Nile, Victoria, Kyoga and Albert. Victoria had its leader Catherine. 
            All teacher liked Catherine because she was hardworking and well behaved.
    </p>
    <p>
     Catherine was at first doing well, as she was practicing with her house members daily. Time came when she was doing 
            the opposite. She became proud of herself in front of other pupils. Whenever she was given some items like glucose and 
            sugarcane to be given out during practice, Catherine kept them to go and share with her friends in the dormitory. 
            Her behavior did not please the members of the house. They decided to report the matter to the house masters.
    </p>
    <p>
     One morning, the teacher and pupils of Victoria house gathered to prepare for the general practice for all the houses. 
            During the meeting, members talked about Catherine’s conduct. Some said that they had given up but the teacher advised 
            Catherine to apologize to the members.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the afternoon, the houses
     <u>
      assembled
     </u>
     for the practice.  This saw Victoria’s participants becoming last in each race. 
            Catherine lost fame and became quiet. The rest of the houses beat Victoria in each and every event. After the general
            practice, Catherine called her members and apologized. She called upon them to regain house spirit. This made her
            buy glucose using some of her pocket money.
    </p>
    <p>
     The awaited day came and participants assembled in the field. In the first event of the long race, the first and the 
            third positions were taken by Victoria house. When the results of the field  events were brought the recording table, 
            Victoria house was leading in most of them and this made Catherine and her house-mates  every happy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally, result were announced. Guess what! Victorians were the
     <u>
      champions
     </u>
     of the year in Nkondo primary school and they
            won themselves a bull.
