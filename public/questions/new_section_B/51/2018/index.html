     Dear Mummy,
    </p>
    <p>
     I am pleased to write to you again after such a long time. How are you and how is work in Nairobi? Back
            here, we are alright and I am preparing for Primary Leaving Examination (PLE).
    </p>
    <p>
     Mummy, I am writing to inform you that our school has successfully registered us for the PLE 2018 and
            we are very happy. Now, I am ready to sit for the Primary Leaving Examination. In fact, all the candidates 
            have been briefed by our head teacher, Mr. Kato Joseph.
    </p>
    <p>
     During the briefing he said, “All of you should take note of the PLE time table. This will help you to know
            how the subjects have been arranged.” He also emphasized that we should read the general instructions
            carefully and those inside the question paper. After that, the head teacher gave a chance to all P.7
            teachers to brief us too. Mrs. Okello, our class teacher advised on filling in information on the first page
            carefully. She also told us to read each question twice, understand and then answer what is required.
    </p>
    <p>
     The other three teachers talked about writing our responses in the spaces provided in the question paper.
            They encouraged us to have confidence in ourselves. They added that all the questions set are within the 
            curriculum. They warned us against any kind of
     <b>
      examination malpractice.
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     Mummy, the teachers also reassured us that we shall pass with flying colors. I am ready and revising 
            seriously following the time table. Pray for me not to forget what I was taught.
    </p>
    <p>
     Please, send my regards to my little brother Jatel Anthony. I wish you all the best while doing your work.
    </p>
    <p>
     Your loving daughter,
     <br/>
     Katoko Elizabeth
