                <p>
                    One week before the end of the school first term, the District Education Officer of Kibu District
                    wrote
                    a
                    letter to all the
                    head teachers of primary schools in the district. This is what the D.E.O said in the letter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All the head teachers of government and private schools must follow what the minister of Education
                    and
                    Sports said about
                    school holidays.The minister said that no primary school in the whole country is allowed to do any
                    teaching
                    during the school holidays.
                    All primary school children must be at home. They need a rest. Children work very hard at school for
                    three
                    months in a term
                    and so they need a rest. Some clever children have even written letters to the Ministry of Education
                    to
                    <u>
                        complain
                    </u>
                    that they
                    are being over worked by making them study during holidays. These children are right. Their brain
                    must
                    rest
                    for sometime.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Parents too must be informed that their children need a rest during school holidays. There are a
                    number
                    of
                    things parents
                    must remember if they want their children to rest
                    <u>
                        properly
                    </u>
                    during the holidays. The first one is
                    that
                    parents must
                    not look for private teachers to teach or coach their children during holidays.The child cannot
                    learn
                    much
                    at that time;
                    the brain is still very tired. The parent is therefore paying the private teacher money for doing
                    nothing to
                    the child.
                    The second thing to remember is that the children should do a lot of play while they are at home for
                    holidays. They can also
                    help their parents with some work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let me say it again. No teaching during the holidays. My inspectors will be visiting schools,
                    classrooms
                    and
                    private places
                    to see if there is any teaching going on anywhere.‚Äù
