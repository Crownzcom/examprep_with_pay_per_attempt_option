    <p>
     One Monday morning, Obibi was
     <u>
      miserable
     </u>
     . This was because it was the beginning of the usual week- long suffering at
            school. Obibi was in Primary Two. In order not to miss staying at home to play with other village children, he 
            developed a plan. He picked his school bag and pretended to go to school. The school was two kilometres from his home.
    </p>
    <p>
     After moving alone along a bushy path to school, he branched immediately to a nearby bush and hid himself under spear grass.
            This was around 8.00am.
    </p>
    <p>
     As he was busy preparing his resting place, some hunters approached the bush where he was hiding. Obibi did not know that the
            roasted cassava he had attracted the dogs. The dogs started running towards his hiding bush at a great speed and the hunters
            followed hurriedly. They thought the dogs had got the smell of a wild animal.
    </p>
    <p>
     Obibi foolishly kept on shaking the grass. One hunter then aimed his spear at the shaking bush. Obibi was only saved when one
            dog jumped to his hiding place. He then made a very loud surprising noise which made the hunters and the dogs to run to 
            different directions. They thought it was a ghost, the god of the forest.
    </p>
    <p>
     The hunters and the dogs then took off in fear of their lives. Obibi ran up to home to report to his parents how he escaped death.
            Instead of punishing Obibi the parents thanked God for saving his life and warned him never to
     <u>
      dodge
     </u>
     going to school again.
