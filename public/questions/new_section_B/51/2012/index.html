            Mrs. Byakikoâ€™s farm at Kolonyi. This followed their lesson on domestic animals by Mr. Amu.

     The pupils started preparing for the jouney as soon as the lesson ended. Some children washed and ironed
            their uniforms, other wrote down question they would ask the farm manger.

     The following morninng on Friday, they woke very early, to prepare. They bathed dressed and had breakfast, 
            immediately the school bus reached the packing yard, they just boarded. On their way, they saw many important place. 
            Their social studies teacher showed them Mabira forest and Kakira factory. Other places were the Coca-cola 
            industry and Kile Tea Estate. He told them how important these places were to the country.

     At the farm, they were welcomed by Mrs. Byakika herself. They were all
     <u>
      surprised
     </u>
     to see the old woman managing
            the farm very well. She had only four workers. The farm was divided into two units. These were units for
     <u>
      livestock
     </u>
     and crops. The livestock unit was for poultry, pigs and diary cows. The crops grown in the farm were maize, coffee and
            greens.

     With the help of workers, Mrs Byakika led the pupils to the different units. At each unit, she explained the
            activities that were taking place there. Some pupils asked questions which she answered very well. She
            encouraged the pupils to start rearing cattle and birds in their homes. Many pupils left the farm promising
            to start their own farm when they grow up.
