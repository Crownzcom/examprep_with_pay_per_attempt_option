    <p>
     Zawadi was woken up by the loud crowing of a cock in the neighborhood. She sat on her bed and this time, forgot to pray, 
            like she used to do. She jumped out of her bed only to realize that everybody was still asleep. She tip-toed to her parents’
             bedroom. Just at the door way, she heard some snoring. This
     <u>
      confirmed
     </u>
     her expectation. “Now is the chance to let everybody 
             know that I can wake up before them,” she said to herself happily.

     In a few minutes she was already dressed and set for school. Opening the door quietly, she got out. She started her journey 
            to school. She was surprised walking for some distance without meeting anybody. This didn’t
     <u>
      scare
     </u>
     her. She continued with 
            her journey until she met a man. The man looked unkind but proved to be kind when he asked to give her a lift on his bicycle. 
            Zawadi accepted and thanked him.

    <p>
     The man rode very fast and even faster towards the school. She told the man that he had passed the school but he pretended not 
            to have heard. The louder she shouted, the faster he rode. Zawadi realized that she was in danger. She immediately prayed to 
            God and contained her tears. When they reached a trading center and saw some people, she shouted for help. “This man is 
            kidnapping me! kidnapping me! kidnapping me! “ she shouted. People at the trading center started running after them. 
            Those who had bicycles rode faster after him. Finally, they caught up with him. The man realizing danger abandoned the bicycle 
            and fled for his life.

     The strong men ran after him while women remained with Zawadi listening to her story. Luckily enough, the man was caught and 
            brought back to the trading center. He was handed over to police. The man was taken to court and charged. He was sentenced to 
            ten years imprisonment for attempted kidnap. Zawadi was handed over to her parents.
