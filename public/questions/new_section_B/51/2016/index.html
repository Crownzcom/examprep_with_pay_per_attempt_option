     In our sub-county, there are two activities done everyday. These are farming and business. 
            Most people are farmers. They grow different crops and rear chicken, goats, cattle. 
            Men and women are both involved in the business. They sell different items including foodstuffs 
            and animal products from their farms.

     Mr. Amooti is among the well known businessmen in the area. He has the biggest shop. 
            In his shop, there is a variety of items. Some are weighed in kilogrammes like sugar, 
            maize flour, rice, beans and groundnuts. Others are packed in bottles, tins or packets 
            like juice, soda, water, shoe polish, salt and baking flour.

            shops. When children go to buy from his shop, he sometimes gives them sweets. It is a reward for 
            choosing to buy from his shop.
