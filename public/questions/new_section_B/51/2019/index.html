    <p>
     One day, my father talked on the phone for a long time. His airtime got used up before he could end
     <br/>
     his talk. He was
     <u>
      conversing
     </u>
     with his workmate, Mr. Obadiya. He decided to send me to buy
     <br/>
     more airtime.
    </p>
    <p>
     Using my bicycle, I rode as first as a horse. I returned within ten minutes with airtime. When I reached,
     <br/>
     I found my father busy listening to the news on the radio. He was so attentive that he didn't want any
     <br/>
     disturbance.He therefore, gave me the mobile phone to load the airtime for him.
    </p>
    <p>
     I was very excited because I was going to load airtime for the first time. I got the airtime and scratched
     <br/>
     it. Since I did not know what to do after scratching, I opened the phone. I placed the airtime card
     <br/>
     between the phone and the battery. I closed the phone. Then I took it to my father thinking I had
     <br/>
     done the right thing.
    </p>
    <p>
     My father immediately tired to call his friend. He dialled repeatedly but the call could not go through.
     <br/>
     "Have you loaded the airtime?" he asked me. I
     <u>
      responded
     </u>
     happily that I had loaded it. He thought
     <br/>
     that his phone had a problem. Then he switched off to open it. As he removed the battery, the airtime card
     <br/>
     dropped on the floor. "Oh my son! You didn't know how to load airtime!" he laughed. I was sad. He held me
     <br/>
     in his arms and said, "don't worry my son. Let's do it together." Then he loaded as I was watching. I was
     <br/>
     very happy to learn how to load airtime.
