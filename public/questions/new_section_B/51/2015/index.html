     To be free from some diseases, people should avoid disease vectors like rats, mosquitoes, fleas and others. 
            These disease vectors spread malaria, cholera, typhoid and dysentery. In order to control the diseases, 
            many measures should be taken into consideration. Such measures include; slashing the bushes around homelands, 
            using clean water, washing our bodies, spraying with insecticides and removing stagnant water around homesteads.
