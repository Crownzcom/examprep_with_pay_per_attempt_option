     There are more species of insects than all animals added altogether. The study of insects is called entomology.
            It is extremely important that we learn about insects since some of them do some damage to man, his animals, 
            crops, stores of food and materials.
    </p>
    <p>
     Despite the terrible damage and diseases caused by some insects, there are benefits that man generally gets from insects.
            Insects play an important part in the pollination of crops. Some insects also produce commercially important products;
            bees produce honey and wax; the silk worms produce the silk threads that are used in the manufacture of expensive fabrics.

     Insects are grouped under Arthropods and have common characteristics such as exoskeleton, joined legs and
     <u>
      segmented
     </u>
     bodies.
            Their bodies are divided into three
     <u>
      distinct
     </u>
     parts, that is, head, thorax and the abdomen. The head, the first part of the
            body, comprises of the feelers and the compound eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     The second part of the body is the thorax and this consists of three segments which bear three pairs of legs.
            The insect with its three pairs of legs can easily be differentiated from spiders which have four pairs.
    </p>
    <p>
     The abdomen is the third part of the body. The segments of the abdomen have no legs but contain various organs of the 
            reproductive system. In some insects there are some structures at the back end of the abdomen which have various functions, 
            for example, egg-laying, as seen at the back-end of bush, crickets or for causing a painful sting, as seen at the back-end
            of wasps.
