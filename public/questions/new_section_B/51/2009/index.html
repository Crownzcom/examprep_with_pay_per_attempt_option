    <p>
     Matilida is the daughter of Bulasio, the well known bicycle repairer in the village. She is the fourth child in the family. 
            In august this year. Matilida turned twelve; she is now in P.7.
    </p>
    <p>
     Each day, during the school term. Matilida walks to school, a distance of nearly three kilometers from home.
            She does so with many other children in the village. They have to walk fast and sometimes run to be in time 
            for the school compound. Matilida and her friends have begun each day like this since they were in P.1. 
            They do it without complaining because they know that general cleaning of the school is part of the
     <u>
      daily routine.
     </u>
    </p>
    <p>
     One day after school, Matilida and her friends started walking back home. They had just gone beyond the local market
            when it started raining heavily, but they continued their journey home. They got worried about their books becoming 
            wet because each one of them carried her books in a small polythene bag. As it continued raining heavily, Matilida
            and her friends started running. Matilida was ahead of the others, showing them where to pass on the wet ground.
            As they passed near a small rock. Matilida slipped on one hidden in a pool of water and fell with all her books. 
            It was still raining heavily. Everyone stopped to help her. She was all covered in mud. She was lucky that the 
            polythene big was properly tied. Minutes later, it stopped raining.
    </p>
    <p>
     They now decided to walk slowly and as they reached their village, each took the path to her home. When Matilida 
            reached home, her mother was unhappy to see her looking like a
     <u>
      ghost.
     </u>
     She helped her to change her clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Afterwards Matilida pulled out everything from her polythene bag. She noticed that her pen and pencil were missing.
            They must have fallen in the pool. Then she saw a hole in her polythene bag! Although it started raining heavily again. 
            Matilida decided to run back to the place where she had fallen in the pool of water.
