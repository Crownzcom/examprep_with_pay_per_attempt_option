                I have a dream….
                <br />
                That one day in the future all the little girls
                <br />
                And little boys in this country
                <br />
                Will be great women and men
                <br />
                <u>

                this country
                <br />
                In a spirit of love.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have a dream…..
                <br />
                My little boy will not despise my little girl
                <br />
                Because she is a girl
                <br />
                And that my little girl will not hate
                <br />
                My little boy because their daddy will have left him
                <br />
                All the wealth because he is a boy.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have a dream….
                <br />
                That a day will come when
                <br />
                All our little boys will be
                <br />
                Responsible fathers educating their children
                <br />
                And all our little girls will be
                <br />
                Loving mothers caring for their children.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have a dream….
                <br />
                That one day all our little girls and little boys
                <br />
                Will walk hand with their children
                <br />
                Singing songs of love and freedom
                <br />
                In a world where there is no hatred
                <br />
                In a world covered with flowers and love.
