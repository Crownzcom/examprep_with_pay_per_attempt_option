     Last term, Malindo Primary School held an election. Ms. Dorothy Awor, the chairperson of the school electoral commission,
            organized the elections. She pinned the lists of
     <u>
      posts
     </u>
     on the notice board. She asked the pupils to apply for the posts.
            Many pupils applied including the well-known boy, Bouncer Bino also known as BB. He was known in the school because of his pride.
            He applied for the post of Head boy. As soon as BB handed in his application, he changed his style of walking.

     Friday was the day for general campaigns. The chairperson called candidates to address the pupils. When BB was called upon,
            pupils cheered him “Our boy BB! Our boy BB! ” However, he was disturbed by something he had no money to please his supporters.

     When he returned home that evening, he asked his dad for some money for the campaigns. BB was very excited when his dad gave 
            him some money. he bought sweets, pan-cakes, buns and gave them quietly to every pupil he believed was his supporter. 
            On the day of the elections, the head teacher, Mr. Matovu was there to monitor the process. He wanted to ensure that there was 
            no
     <u>
      rigging
     </u>
     Indeed, there was free and fair elections.

     When Ms. Dorothy Awor announced the results, a very humble boy who did not spend money was elected head boy. Bouncer Bino, 
            had lost. He was very disappointed and so were his parents. BB accepted the results and advised his supporters to work together 
            with the newly elected prefects. Mr. Matovu appreciated BB’s action and thanked him for the good spirit of togetherness
