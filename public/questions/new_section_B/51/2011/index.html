     Waya primary school is a day school in the middle of Seseme village. In this school, lunch is given only 
            to those pupils whose parents have paid lunch money.
    </p>
    <p>
     One day, four boys and three girls studying in this school started their journey home. It was after the
            afternoon classes. None of their parents had paid the lunch money. These children were hungry and weak.
            On their way, they saw a mango tree with some
     <u>
      ripe
     </u>
     fruits on it.
    </p>
    <p>
     ‘’I am hungry. Why don’t we visit that mango tree for fruits?’’ Bruno, one of the boys asked. ‘’Yaah’’, 
            his friend Robert shouted excitedly. The rest including the girls supported the idea.
    </p>
    <p>
     All the seven of them approached the tree. They saw the ripe fruits. They started to throw some stones
            at them. One of the girls, Kawudha said, ‘’I see a bee-hive on that big branch’’. ‘’We shall not climb
            but just throw stones. Make sure you don’t disturb the bees’’, Robert said.
    </p>
    <p>
     They started throwing stones at the ripe mangoes. Some mangoes fell on the ground. Unfortunately, 
            quite a number of mangoes fell on the bee-hive. The boys and girls started collecting mangoes which
            had fallen on the ground. Suddenly, a
     <u>
      swarm
     </u>
     of bees rushed out of the beehive. The bees attacked 
            all of them. Each one of them was running towards the road. The bees followed them and stung everyone. 
            They threw away all the ripe mangoes they had picked.
    </p>
    <p>
     ‘’Fall down and cover yourselves with grass!’’ shouted Mathew. All of them did so. After a few minutes 
            the bees went back to their beehive. The girls remained on the ground crying. The boys called the girls
            as they were removing the grass from their bodies. They continued their journey home. Their mouths, 
            hands, eyes, noses, ears and other parts of their bodies were swollen.
    </p>
    <p>
     When they reached home, their parents saw the way each one of them looked. They were sorry for their children. 
            One of the boys told the parents that they were very hungry since they did not get lunch at school.The parents 
            were concerned and after treating their children they went with them to school and they talked to the head teacher.
