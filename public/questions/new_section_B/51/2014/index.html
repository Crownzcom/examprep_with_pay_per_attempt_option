     My name is Nakato and I am a primary seven candidate in Piri Boarding Primary School. I have a short story to share
            with fellow candidates.
    </p>
    <p>
     Last year, during the second term holiday, my mother sent me to the market. She wanted me to buy a pumpkin. 
            I asked Bruno, my half brother, to come along with me. A short distance away from home, we met an old man. 
            He was carrying bag made out of dry palm leaves. He looked a very poor old man from a village. He smiled 
            and greeted us. Bruno answered but I kept quiet. I did not like the way he was dressed. He then asked us 
            to
     <u>
      direct
     </u>
     him to the house of a lawyer, Mr. Mutebi. I never wanted Bruno to direct him to our home but he did. 
            This hurt me so much that I felt like fighting Bruno. He told me that it was bad manners to treat
     <u>
      strangers
     </u>
     like that.
    </p>
    <p>
     Immediately we got back home, my mother welcomed us. She was very happy to have a visitor. The visitor was the 
            old man we had met on the way. She asked us to greet him. Bruno went immediately and shook his hand. I pretended 
            that I was taking the pumpkin to the kitchen. My mother was very angry with me. She asked if that was the kind 
            of respect I showed to elders. She continued to shout at me saying that the old man was my grandfather. 
            “calm down my daughter, Nakato has heard”, said the old man. He then picked a watch from the old bag and 
            handed it to my half brother. “Bruno, may God bless you my grandson”, he said.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh My God! I missed a very beautiful watch. I was ashamed before my mother and grandfather too. Fellow candidates, 
            I advise you to always respect elders. It is also important to help and direct strangers. Always respect, love and 
            care for everyone.
