    <p>
     Birds are singing in the forest
     <br/>
     <u>
      Waves
     </u>
     are moving on River Nile,
     <br/>
     And leaves are all shaking,
     <br/>
     In the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
     The clock’s hands go on turning,
     <br/>
     And the school boys and girls of P7 go on learning,
     <br/>
     But I’m crying, simply crying,
     <br/>
     For the lesson to end.
     <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
     When I am old, not strong,
     <br/>
     When I am at school, no longer,
     <br/>
     When lesson times and school days are
     <u>
      over,
     </u>
     <br/>
     If there is singing in the forest,
     <br/>
     If there are waves on the River Nile,
     <br/>
     If leaves are all there,
     <br/>
     And, the sun is out,
     <br/>
     I will greet all of them.
