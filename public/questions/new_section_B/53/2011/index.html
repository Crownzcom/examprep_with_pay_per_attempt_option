    <p>
     Teacher says your name is Malaria
     <br/>
     That your parent is an insect
     <br/>
     That insect with many legs
     <br/>
     Which sucks hungrily people’s blood
     <br/>
     Where it puts you to live.
    </p>
    <p>
     Last week doctors saw you in my blood
     <br/>
     Your parent had injected you into it
     <br/>
     You lived in my blood for days.
     <br/>
     But doctor found you’re here hiding
     <br/>
     Giving me headache and fever.
    </p>
    <p>
     A whole week no school for me
     <br/>
     Couldn’t drink or eat anything
     <br/>
     You couldn’t let me play games
     <br/>
     And couldn’t
     <u>
      revise
     </u>
     my books for examination
     <br/>
     Coming just a week after.
    </p>
    <p>
     Doctor saw you many in my blood
     <br/>
     He wrote something for nurse
     <br/>
     Nurse read it and
     <u>
      prepared
     </u>
     a syringe
     <br/>
     I lay on the table head down
     <br/>
     And closed my red eyes and waited.
