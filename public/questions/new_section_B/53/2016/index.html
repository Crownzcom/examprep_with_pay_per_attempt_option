      Oh yes. They are very delicious and they can be eaten in different ways. They can be prepared as porridge, chips, bread, 
                doughnuts and boiled potatoes. The leaves can be used as sauce and are very rich in vitamins.

      Donâ€™t worry, I will take you where to get the cuttings. Some schools in the district are doing very 
                well in growing orange fleshed sweet potatoes. They have school gardens. In fact, they are very good for feeding pupils at 
                school instead of carrying leftover food to school.
