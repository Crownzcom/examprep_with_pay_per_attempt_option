     Teacher,  Oh! My teacher!
     <br/>
     What should I call you?
     <br/>
     I wish to choose a name for you
     <br/>
     But I can't get one, not at all.
    </p>
    <p>
     I hear you command children,
     <br/>
     Got to classrooms! Class! Class!
     <br/>
     Don't step on grass! No trespassing.
     <br/>
     Teacher, are you a policeman?
    </p>
    <p>
     Class time, you make me  forget home,
     <br/>
     Teaching me skills, skills!
     <br/>
     To make my future bright
     <br/>
     Teacher, are you a  caretaker?
    </p>
    <p>
     Break time, you tell me  to share, share!
     <br/>
     Packed snacks, water, juice, everythinng.
     <br/>
     You sing, please share with friends,
     <br/>
     Teacher, are you a parent? You are!
    </p>
