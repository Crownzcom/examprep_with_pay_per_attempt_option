            <p>
                Where is my nice pen?
                <br />
                I want to write letter
                <br />
                To my children
                <br />
                And send them money.
            </p>
            <p>
                I will not tell them
                <br />
                I am here
                <br />
                I don’t want them
                <br />
                To know that I am
                <br />
                A prisoner,
                <br />
                I want them to grow up
                <br />
                Without suffering,
                <br />
                I want them to pass
                <br />
                Their examinations
                <br />
                And get good jobs
                <br />
                And buy land,
                <br />
                Houses,
                <br />
                Cars……
            </p>
            <p>
                I do not want my children
                <br />
                To get shocked,
                <br />
                I do not want them
                <br />
                To feel sad and sorry
                <br />
                And cry for me,
                <br />
                I do not want them to know
                <br />
                That my hands and feet
                <br />
                Are tied with ropes
                <br />
                And I am sitting
                <br />
                On the naked thigh
                <br />
                Of the stone floor
                <br />
