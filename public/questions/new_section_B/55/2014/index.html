    <p>
     I connect everybody in the world
     <br/>
     Ready to serve if you feed me
     <br/>
     Airtime is my
     <u>
      favorite
     </u>
     meal
     <br/>
     Measured according to the user’s pocket
     <br/>
     From as low as five hundred shillings.
    </p>
    <p>
     I am mobile and easy to carry,
     <br/>
     In the pocket of hand bad’ I am present
     <br/>
     Ready to be used
     <br/>
     To send or receive a message
     <br/>
     As the user may choose.
    </p>
    <p>
     I
     <u>
      connect
     </u>
     people near and far
     <br/>
     To talk and laugh
     <br/>
     But for seconds, minutes or hours
     <br/>
     But I quickly switch off
     <br/>
     When my meal gets finished.
    </p>
    <p>
     I can be your bank
     <br/>
     As I keep or carry your money safely
     <br/>
     Without using even a coin
     <br/>
     I deliver it all to the receiver
     <br/>
     To pay fees or solve other problems
     <br/>
